    ` *For clients intending to file Chapter 13 Bankruptcy with our law firm we
      will file a client's case with no attorney fees upfront before the case is
      filed. However the client in most instances will have to pay the filing
      fee & costs upfront before our firm files a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. For
      clients intending to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, a qualified guarantor of
      attorney fees is required for $0 Down Bankruptcy. Also, for clients
      intending to file Chapter 7; the filing fee & costs are required to be
      paid upfront before the case can be filed.`,

    ` Our office can get your case filed without an office visit. Documents
      necessary to do so will have to be mailed or emailed to our office. A
      client filing bankruptcy, will however, be required to personally appear
      in court at a "meeting of creditors" to receive a discharge of debt. Also,
      other hearings may require a personal appearance by the client at a public
      court hearing. You will still meet with an attorney from our office by
      video or phone throughout the process. An attorney will be with you at all
      hearings for you to complete your case.`,
